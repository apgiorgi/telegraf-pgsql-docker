## Telegraf with PostgreSQL output plugin from @phemmer

This image is built including the custom output plugin for PostgreSQL, from **https://github.com/phemmer/telegraf/tree/postgres**

Plugin usage docs can be found at **https://github.com/phemmer/telegraf/tree/postgres/plugins/outputs/postgresql**

# NOTE

This is a temporary workaround until the official release of Telegraf includes the output plugin.

# Telegraf

Telegraf is an open-source agent written in Go for collecting, processing, aggregating, and writing metrics.
